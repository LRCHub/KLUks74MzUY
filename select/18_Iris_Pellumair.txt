It's up to you the air
That you that you want sleep alone
Than she reminds the end of days
If you come back with alone
It's all for you me love to tell
When you feel like letting go
The things she says, at the break of days
Makes you feel like mascarpone

I'm trying to say
Giving nothing away
I'm trying to say
Giving nothing away

It's up to you the air
That you that you want sleep alone
Than she reminds the end of days
If you come back with alone
It's all for you me love to tell
When you feel like letting go
The things she says, at the break of days
Makes you feel like mascarpone

I'm trying to say
Giving nothing away
I'm trying to say
Giving nothing away
(Get up)
I'm trying to say
(Get up)
Giving nothing away
I'm trying to say
(Get up)
Giving nothing away
