[00:12.00] And I'd give up forever to touch you
[00:16.36] 'Cause I know that you feel me somehow
[00:21.03] You're the closest to heaven that I'll ever be
[00:25.86] And I don't want to go home right now
[00:44.36] 
[00:30.82] And all I can taste is this moment
[00:35.65] And all I can breathe is your life
[00:40.15] And sooner or later, it's over
[00:44.58] I just don't wanna miss you tonight
[01:02.08] 
[00:49.17] And I don't want the world to see me
[00:53.96] 'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
[00:58.87] When everything's made to be broken
[01:03.36] I just want you to know who I am
[01:19.36] 
[01:20.02] And you can't fight the tears that ain't coming
[01:24.21] Or the moment of truth in your lies
[01:29.45] When everything feels like the movies
[01:33.94] Yeah, you bleed just to know, you're alive
[01:54.94] 
[01:38.78] And I don't want the world to see me
[01:43.25] 'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
[01:48.69] When everything's made to be broken
[01:52.72] I just want you to know who I am
[02:08.72] 
[03:30.59] And I don't want the world to see me
[03:35.33] 'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
[03:40.28] When everything's made to be broken
[03:44.45] I just want you to know who I am
[04:00.45] 
[03:51.43] And I don't want the world to see me
[03:56.07] 'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
[04:00.67] When everything's made to be broken
[04:05.05] I just want you to know who I am
[04:21.05] 
[04:09.56] I just want you to know who I am
[04:14.16] I just want you to know who I am
[04:18.95] I just want you to know who I am
