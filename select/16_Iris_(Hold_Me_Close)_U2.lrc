[00:35.07] The star that gives us light
[00:41.64] Has been gone a while
[00:45.42] But it's not an illusion
[00:49.89] The ache in my heart
[00:56.68] Is so much a part of who I am
[01:05.31] Something in your eyes
[01:08.76] Took a thousand years to get here
[01:12.77] Something in your eyes
[01:16.31] Took a thousand years, a thousand years
[01:19.93] Hold me close
[01:23.75] Hold me close and don't let me go
[01:26.94] Hold me close
[01:31.31] Like I'm someone that you might know
[01:34.57] Hold me close
[01:38.89] The darkness just lets us see
[01:42.28] Who we are
[01:46.37] I've got your life inside of me
[01:53.72] Iris, Iris
[02:06.18] Once we are born
[02:12.25] We begin to forget
[02:15.76] The very reason we came
[02:20.19] But you I'm sure I've met
[02:27.24] Long before the night
[02:29.54] The stars went out
[02:30.88] We're meeting up again
[02:35.52] Hold me close
[02:39.33] Hold me close and don't let me go
[02:43.11] Hold me close
[02:47.10] Like I'm someone that you might know
[02:50.56] Hold me close
[02:54.62] The darkness just lets us see
[02:57.98] Who we are
[03:01.95] I've got your life inside of me
[03:09.31] Iris, Iris
[03:26.27] The stars are bright
[03:27.81] But do they know
[03:33.56] The universe is beautiful but cold
[03:42.24] You took me by the hand
[03:45.87] I thought that I was leading you
[03:49.51] But it was you made me your man
[03:52.89] Machine, I dream where you are
[03:59.37] Iris standing in the hall
[04:02.76] She tells me I can do it all
[04:06.61] Iris wakes to my nightmares
[04:10.25] Don't fear the world
[04:12.20] It isn't there
[04:14.60] Iris playing on the Strand
[04:18.00] She buries the boy beneath the sand
[04:21.87] Iris says that I will be the death of her
[04:27.59] It was not me
[04:32.53] Iris, Iris
[04:43.57] She said free yourself to be yourself
[04:48.61] If only you could see yourself
[04:52.17] Free yourself to be yourself
[04:55.77] If only you could see
