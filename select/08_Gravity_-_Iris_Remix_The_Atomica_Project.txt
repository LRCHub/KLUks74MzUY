I was hurt
I was down
I was struggling
And I tried to warn you
To let me recover
On your own
You detailed how to save me
I said get away from me
But you would defend me
Look what it's done to you
We all saw this coming
Coming right after you
You just failed to see the gravity

I tried to protect you
But look what it's done to you
We all saw this coming
But we both failed to see the gravity

I will stay in your arms for the aftermath
And I try to want you
To let you be close to me
But the hurt, the assault was so shattering
I see you as threatening
But you would defend me
Look what it's done to you
We all saw this coming
Coming right after you
You just failed to see the gravity
I tried to protect you
But look what it's done to you
We all saw this coming
But we both failed to see the gravity

Look what it's done to you
We all saw this coming
Coming right after you
You just failed to see the gravity

I tried to protect you
But look what it's done to you
We all saw this coming
But we both failed to see the gravity
